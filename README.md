This is a simple savings smart contract, the goal of this smart contract is to allow users to be able to deposit their eth and debby tokens into the smart contract at their will.

Let me give an updated explanation:
In the Eth functions users can do the following:
1. Deposit their tokens into the smart contract
2. Withdraw their tokens from the smart contract
3. Get their balance
4. There is an only owner function of getting the contract balance.

In the DEBBY ERC20 token functions:
1. Users can deposit their debby token into the smart contract;
2. Users can withdraw at will from the smart contract.
3. Get their balance.
4. AN only owner function to get the contract balance.

There is mapping in the smart contract to further keep record of the deposit and withdrawal.

How to use this smart contract.
